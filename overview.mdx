Thesis is an AI-powered search engine designed specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi). Our platform provides intelligent search capabilities, conversation management, and comprehensive space information to help you navigate the DeFi ecosystem.

## Core Functionalities

Thesis offers three primary API endpoints to power your DeFi search applications:

### 1. Create New Conversation for DeFi Search

Start intelligent conversations about DeFi topics using our conversation API.

```bash
POST /api/v1/integration/conversations
```

Create new conversation threads that can intelligently search and analyze DeFi protocols, tokens, and market data. Perfect for building chatbots or interactive DeFi research tools.

### 2. Query Conversation

Retrieve and continue existing conversations with full context and history.

```bash
GET /api/v1/integration/conversations/{conversation_id}
```

Access conversation history, search results, and AI insights from previous interactions. Maintain context across multiple queries for deeper DeFi analysis.
